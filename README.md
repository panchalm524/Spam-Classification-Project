# spam-classifier
Spam Classifier built using CountVectorizer and Tf-idf Vectorizer. 
Source of dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset
We employed Upsampling and Cross-val in our project, and built the following models:
-Naive Bayes model with imbalanced dataset, using CountVectorizer
-Naive Bayes model with imbalanced dataset, using Tf-idf Vectorizer
-Naive Bayes model with cross-validation, using CountVectorizer
-Naive Bayes model with cross-validation, using Tf-idf Vectorizer
-Decision Tree models wirth imbalanced dataset, cross-val, and upsampled data.
We reported the f-measure and accuracy scores of each model as part of our findings in our powerpoint presentation, which is uploaded as well.
